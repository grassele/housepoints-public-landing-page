    <h1>HousePoints Mobile App: Smarter Chore-Tracking</h1>
    <h3>
        An app to help parents engage their children in learning accountability and simple financial<br>
        goal-setting through a system inspired by Hogwarts House points from Harry Potter
    </h3>

    <h4>Why do current chore-tracking apps fall short?</h4>
    <p>
        From a parent's point of view, current apps don't address the need for practical and<br>
        up-to-date solutions for teaching their kids important life skills such as financial literacy,<br>
        accountability, and taking responsibility for their actions. They want an effective tool that<br>
        simplifies teaching these skills in a way that's fun and interactive.
    </p>
    <p>
        For kids, the approaches used by other apps and traditional chore-tracking or rewards systems are<br>
        too boring offers little incentive to stay motivated and engaged in participating. Instead, they want<br>
        something more exciting and interactive that motivates them to do chores and behave well. 
    </p>
    
    <h4>How is HousePoints Different?</h4>
    <p>
        HousePoints empowers parents to instill lifelong habits in their children through organized systems<br>
        for allowances, rewards, and consequences based on their behavior. Drawing inspiration from the Hogwarts<br>
        house points system in the Harry Potter&reg; series, HousePoints creates a merit-based framework where<br>
        youngsters can accumulate points for completing tasks and exhibiting positive conduct, while points are<br>
        deducted for misbehavior and failing to take responsibility. When points are earned, kids have the choice<br>
        to use them as real-world currency or to continue saving for a greater reward in the future.

    <h4>GENERAL APPLICATION STRUCTURE</h4>
    <p>
        HousePoints was built with the popular RESTful architecture for mobile applications.<br>
        This means a front-end or client makes requests to the back-end or server, which stores<br>
        the application data and manages it per the client's instructions.
    </p>
    <h4>BACK-END</h4>
    <p> 
        Our RESTful application's back-end code is written in Python. We inherited a basic model<br>
        of code from some of our project partner's previous work, where asynchronous functions<br>
        interact directly with the database, performing edits or requesting information from it,<br>
        and then these functions connect to endpoints, aka URLs that the client can use.
    </p>
    <h4>FRONT-END</h4>
    <p>   
        For our front-end, we used React-Native, a mobile application client framework that is cross-platform<br>
        (can be run on both Android and iOS devices). React-Native allows you to implement screens, their visual<br>
        formats and data population, and navigation between screens. Our application gets populated with data from<br>
        our backend, so our front-end interacts with the back-end using the URLs for endpoints we created.
