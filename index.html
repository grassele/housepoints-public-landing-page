<h1>HousePoints Mobile App: Smarter Chore-Tracking</h1>
<p>
    An app to help parents engage their children in learning accountability and simple financial goal-setting through a system inspired by Hogwarts House points from Harry Potter
</p>
<h4>GENERAL APPLICATION STRUCTURE</h4>
<p>
    HousePoints was built with the popular RESTful architecture for mobile applications. \
    This means a front-end or client makes requests to the back-end or server, which stores \
    the application data and manages it per the client's instructions.
</p>
<h4>BACK-END</h4>
<p> 
    Our RESTful application's back-end code is written in Python. We inherited a basic model \
    of code from some of our project partner's previous work, where asynchronous functions \
    interact directly with the database, performing edits or requesting information from it, \
    and then these functions connect to endpoints, aka URLs that the client can use.
</p>
<h4>FRONT-END</h4>
<p>   
    For our front-end, we used React-Native, a mobile application client framework that is cross-platform \
    (can be run on both Android and iOS devices). React-Native allows you to implement screens, their visual \
    formats and data population, and navigation between screens. Our application gets populated with data from \
    our backend, so our front-end interacts with the back-end using the URLs for endpoints we created.
