<h4>Why do current chore-tracking apps fall short?</h4>
<p>
    From a parent's point of view, current apps don't address the need for practical and<br>
    up-to-date solutions for teaching their kids important life skills such as financial literacy,<br>
    accountability, and taking responsibility for their actions. They want an effective tool that<br>
    simplifies teaching these skills in a way that's fun and interactive.
</p>
<p>
    For kids, the approaches used by other apps and traditional chore-tracking or rewards systems are<br>
    too boring offers little incentive to stay motivated and engaged in participating. Instead, they want<br>
    something more exciting and interactive that motivates them to do chores and behave well.

<h4>GENERAL APPLICATION STRUCTURE</h4>
<p>
    HousePoints was built with the popular RESTful architecture for mobile applications.<br>
    This means a front-end or client makes requests to the back-end or server, which stores<br>
    the application data and manages it per the client's instructions.
</p>
<h4>BACK-END</h4>
<p> 
    Our RESTful application's back-end code is written in Python. We inherited a basic model<br>
    of code from some of our project partner's previous work, where asynchronous functions<br>
    interact directly with the database, performing edits or requesting information from it,<br>
    and then these functions connect to endpoints, aka URLs that the client can use.
</p>
<h4>FRONT-END</h4>
<p>   
    For our front-end, we used React-Native, a mobile application client framework that is cross-platform<br>
    (can be run on both Android and iOS devices). React-Native allows you to implement screens, their visual<br>
    formats and data population, and navigation between screens. Our application gets populated with data from<br>
    our backend, so our front-end interacts with the back-end using the URLs for endpoints we created.
